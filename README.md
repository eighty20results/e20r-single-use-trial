Limits a registered PMPro member from signing up for a specific membership level more than once.

### Description
This plugin requires the Paid Memberships Pro plugin by Stranger Studios, LLC.

The plugin will prevent a single user ID (member) from signing up to a membership level more than once.

`WARNING: There are ways for a member to bypass this setting. The simplest workaround is to register as a new user` <br />
on your site during the checkout process. Unfortunately, there is no fool-proof way to disable this workaround.

### Installation

1. Upload the `e20r-single-use-trial` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory of your site.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. Configure via the "Memberships" -> "Membership Levels" settings page, under the "Single Use Trial Settings" section for each level.
